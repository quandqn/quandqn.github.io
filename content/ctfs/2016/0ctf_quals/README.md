### equation 

After 48 hours "fighting", our team CLGT-MeePwn was ranked 12th. Here is my idea for solution of a 2-point cryptography task – equation.
We was given a [zip](http://dl.0ops.net/equation.zip) file contain a "mask" RSA private key photo, and an encoded flag.

Instead of trying to retype the private key (or using some OCR tools), I recognize that there is a private key which was hidden in the photo. Use binwalk to extract it.

Based on the format of normal RSA private key, we can recover something from the given key: some LSBs of $q, d_p, d_q$ and $q_{inv}$.

$$
\\d _p \equiv d \mod (p -1) \\ d _q \equiv d \mod (q -1) \\ q_{inv} \equiv q^{-1} \mod p
$$

If we multiple the second equation with exponent $e$, it becomes:

$$
\\ \varphi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)\\ \iff ed_q \equiv 1 &plus; k(q -1) \mod \varphi(n)
$$

From above equation and assuming that $e = 65537$ (default value), we know value $k(q–1)$. We also know $q$ is prime number, so $q–1$ is an even number. Try to factorize $k(q–1)$ and note that $k < e$, we can recover $q$. Redo that step with $p$ or using the "coefficient" $q_{inv}$, we can recover $p$.

When we have $p$ and $q$, now we easily decrypt the flag.

The flag is `0ctf{Keep_ca1m_and_s01ve_the_RSA_Eeeequati0n!!!}`.
